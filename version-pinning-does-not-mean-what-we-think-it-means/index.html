<p>I made this article mostly because of:</p>
<ul>
<li>(Unmaintained) Docker images breaking because of unpinned dependencies</li>
<li>npm, pip, or almost any package manager that allows native code bundling where you can have a system library that's either incompatible with the runtime or your system. This also holds true for non-native code.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why would you ever expect people to guess the requirements of your software?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Version pinning is no Whac-A-Mole game, it's about giving real meaning to our versioning.</li>
<li>Version pinning is not the product of a carefully planned decision, it is the only possible real technical choice in terms of versioning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Manifests are great tools, they are not about drawing ascii on a text document, they are about giving as many guarantees as possible to the people that will be building and running our software.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-lock-json">Most</a> RVS backends insist on abusing <a href="https://semver.org">semver</a> as if it ever could possibly achieve its intended goal. A version number says nothing about a software integrity which is all anyone should care for, it's not a date (which would actually means something) and it's not a checksum either (which would say a lot about its integrity).</p>
<p>Do not fool yourself, dependencies do not auto-manage themselves and never will, all the elements that make up the stacks shoul dbe interoperable which can only be the result of careful testings.</p>
<p>Manifests are not just a meant to create automated builds, they are a mean for softwares to be platform-agnostic because no end user should ever be expected to reverse-engineer a stack in order to make things interoperable (again).</p>
<h2 id="the-obvious-solution">The (obvious) solution</h2>
<p>Hard pin all your dependencies and make your requirements clear however you can.</p>
<h2 id="the-ending-theme">The ending theme</h2>
<p>The time of praying for software to build and run properly are long gone, I pray that we stop praying and start producing true reproducible builds.</p>
