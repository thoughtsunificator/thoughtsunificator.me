Anime Twist Premium is a browser extension that adds a watch list to twist.moe making it possible to track the shows you're currently watching.

## How it works

### Adding an anime to your watchlist

Navigate to the page of the anime of your choice.

There you will be able to see that a new "+" button appeared below the video player:

![atp-anime](/image/atp-anime.webp)

### Acessing your watch list

Next to the settings button or chat button you will see a new button:

![atp-watchlist-menu](/image/atp-watchlist-menu.webp)

When clicked, a popup will appear:

![atp-watchlist](/image/atp-watchlist.webp)

You can also look up your entries:

![atp-lookup](/image/atp-lookup.webp)

That's it, you now have easy access to the shows you're watching and can look them up.

### Bonus (v1.4)
